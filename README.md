This is my personal practice on Linked List in 3 languages (C, C++, Python).  

## TODO
- [x] Remove nodes  
- [ ] Stack  
- [ ] Queue  

## Furthermore
- Two directions (`prev` and `next`) and other variations.
- Functional programming versions
`insert_node(data_structure, node)` so that increases flexibility.
